# oc mint sample

this is a C++ implementation of the opencoin protocol 
as mapping to some kind of REST interface 

actually it is a work in progress.

## Protocol Questions

- What is signed as cdd - only the content of the cdd item with curly braces 
or also the key?
- the weighted URL as array has a different js encoding as other elements

## TODO

- [x] complete from_json conversions
- [x] complete tests
- [x] drone config
